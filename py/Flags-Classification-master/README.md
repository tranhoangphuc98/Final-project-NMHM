# Flags-Classification

This is a mini project done to cap off the machine learning module of the Data Star program at CADS. My partner [Shariff](https://github.com/ShariffAbidinsa) and I spent 2 days doing exploratory data analysis, cleaning the dataset, and using several machine learning models to predict some output feature based on a number of input features.

## About the dataset

The dataset was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), and contains details of various countries and their flags. Although there is no clear indication on what should be the output feature, we both decided to try and predict the religion based on all the other features.

### Features

2. **landmass**:	1=N.America, 2=S.America, 3=Europe, 4=Africa, 4=Asia, 6=Oceania 
3. **zone**:	Geographic quadrant, based on Greenwich and the Equator; 1=NE, 2=SE, 3=SW, 4=NW 
4. **area**:	in thousands of square km 
5. **population**:	in round millions 
6. **language**: 1=English, 2=Spanish, 3=French, 4=German, 5=Slavic, 6=Other Indo-European, 7=Chinese, 8=Arabic, 9=Japanese/Turkish/Finnish/Magyar, 10=Others 
7. **religion**: 0=Catholic, 1=Other Christian, 2=Muslim, 3=Buddhist, 4=Hindu, 5=Ethnic, 6=Marxist, 7=Others 
8. **bars**: Number of vertical bars in the flag 
9. **stripes**: Number of horizontal stripes in the flag 
10. **colours**: Number of different colours in the flag 
11. **red**: 0 if red absent, 1 if red present in the flag 
12. **green**: same for green 
13. **blue**: same for blue 
14. **gold**: same for gold (also yellow) 
15. **white**: same for white 
16. **black**: same for black 
17. **orange**: same for orange (also brown) 
18. **mainhue**: predominant colour in the flag (tie-breaks decided by taking the topmost hue, if that fails then the most central hue, and if that fails the leftmost hue) 
19. **circles**: Number of circles in the flag 
20. **crosses**: Number of (upright) crosses 
21. **saltires**: Number of diagonal crosses 
22. **quarters**: Number of quartered sections 
23. **sunstars**: Number of sun or star symbols 
24. **crescent**: 1 if a crescent moon symbol present, else 0 
25. **triangle**: 1 if any triangles present, 0 otherwise 
26. **icon**: 1 if an inanimate image present (e.g., a boat), otherwise 0 
27. **animate**: 1 if an animate image (e.g., an eagle, a tree, a human hand) present, 0 otherwise 
28. **text**: 1 if any letters or writing on the flag (e.g., a motto or slogan), 0 otherwise 
29. **topleft**: colour in the top-left corner (moving right to decide tie-breaks) 
30. **botright**: Colour in the bottom-left corner (moving left to decide tie-breaks)
